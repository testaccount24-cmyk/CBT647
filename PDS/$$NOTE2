Hi Sam,

I have attached another update (1.9.3) to CBT File 647 (Rexx XML
Parser). This version has been improved with bug fixes and code
contributions from Alessandro Battilani (Banca Intessa, Italy)
and Herbert Frommwieser and Anne Feldmeier (BMW, Germany).

The JCL-to-XML converter (jcl2xml.rexx) has seen the most changes
- including support for JES3 statements and Tivoli Workload
Scheduler directives. The change logs at the beginning of each
rexx file have more detail.

Cheers,
A.
