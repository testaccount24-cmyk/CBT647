Hi Sam,

This is an update to File 647 (rexx XML parser) package.
New in V1.9:

1. New: IDL2WSDL - Converts an EntireX Interface Definition
   Language (IDL) file to a Web Services Description Language (WSDL)
   file.  This could be useful for people who want to re-implement
   SoftwareAG EntireX applications as Web Services (on CICS for
   example).

2. Updated: REXXPP - An improved Rexx include pre-processor now
   prompts the user when a file to be included cannot be found.

Cheers,
A.
