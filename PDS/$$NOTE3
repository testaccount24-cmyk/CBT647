Subject:  Re: REXX INCLUDE ?

FWIW, I wrote an "INCLUDE" processor for Rexx as part of my Rexx
XML Parser many moons ago. I've recently published it as a
SourceForge project (more current than the CBT647 file - no
offence to CBT guys, it's just that I like the subversion version
control that sourceforge provides). See:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/rexxxmlparser/

...and browse the SVN code repository for rexxpp.rex. It's nothing
magical (i.e. any rexx programmer could have done it) but I found
it useful for my purposes.

The idea is that you run it to regenerate your Rexx source which
has the INCLUDE directives embedded as comments. A new Rexx source
file is produced with all the most current "included" source files.
You could do that at run time, but it would be additional overhead.
Probably best to just regenerate your source files whenever an
"included" file changes.

Cheers,
Andrew.
